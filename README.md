<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

During the holidays and off-peak periods, some students who stay on the campus find themselves alone in their rooms of 9m2. They quickly succumb to loneliness and boredom due to lack of activities but most of all human contacts. The app goal is to gather these people allowing them to organize and participate to events reserved for INSA students:

- Private events : Big parties, chill ones, netflix and chill, game nights...
- Trips in Lyon : Restaurants, bowling, laser games, cinema, pubs...
- Trips outside Lyon: Hiking, rafting...
